Hello. Hey Francis, this is Garrett with Devstroot. How are you doing?

Prospect  0:07
Yeah. Should I know you?

Agent  0:13
Not unless you saw the email that I sent you last week. I was just calling actually to follow up on those but I take it you probably haven't seen it yet.

Prospect  0:26
I have no idea why you're calling me I certainly have not seen any emails.

Agent  0:33
Okay. No worries.

Prospect  0:34
How did you get my email address?

Agent  0:38
Through LinkedIn?

Prospect  0:52
just sad. Like I don't like if you're selling me something you just done yourself a huge disservice. Why are you calling me?

 Cuz I think our platform could help you guys out over at Giant Games.

Prospect  1:17
 You want to sell me something. So I'm going to say goodbye. Don't call again!
