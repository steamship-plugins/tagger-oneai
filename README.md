# Steamship OneAI Plugin

This project contains a Steamship Tagger plugin that enables use of OneAI's text tagging pipeline.

We recommend using Python virtual environments for development.
To set one up, run the following command from this directory:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
```

Activate your virtual environment by running:

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Your first time, install the required dependencies with:

```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements.dev.txt
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Developing

All the code for this plugin is located in the `src/api.py` file:

* The ParserPlugin class
* The `/parse` endpoint

## Testing

Tests are located in the `test/test_api.py` file. You can run them with:

```bash

```

We have provided sample data in the `test_data/` folder.
